## Think 20 mins a day!

```
Programming myself to program (think) quickly! The aim isn't to master anything, I just wanna challenge my brain to think effectively and solve problems. No fancy algorithms, No hard problems, just simple easy to program codes.
```
```
This repository will be my programming dumping ground.
